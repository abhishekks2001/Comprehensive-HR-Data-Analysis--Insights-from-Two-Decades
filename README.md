# Comprehensive-HR-Data-Analysis--Insights-from-Two-Decades-

### PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project delves into a thorough examination of human resources (HR) data spanning two decades, from 2000 to 2020, leveraging SQL for data analysis and Power BI for visualization. Through meticulous analysis, cleaning, and querying of the dataset, a comprehensive understanding of various HR metrics such as gender, race, age distribution, location, tenure, and turnover rates across different departments was achieved.

Using SQL, the dataset underwent rigorous examination to extract meaningful insights. This involved querying the data to identify trends, patterns, and correlations within the HR dataset. The SQL queries were designed to explore aspects such as employee demographics, tenure distribution, turnover rates over time, and departmental performance metrics.

Subsequently, the insights gleaned from SQL analysis were visualized using Power BI, a powerful business analytics tool. The interactive dashboard created in Power BI provides a user-friendly interface for stakeholders to explore and comprehend the HR data insights effortlessly. Through various visualizations such as charts, graphs, and interactive filters, the dashboard presents a holistic view of the HR metrics, facilitating informed decision-making.

Key findings from the analysis include trends in gender representation, racial diversity, age distribution across different departments, geographic variations in workforce demographics, tenure patterns, and turnover rates over the two-decade period. These insights offer actionable recommendations for optimizing the workforce, improving diversity and inclusion initiatives, enhancing retention strategies, and optimizing departmental performance.

Overall, this project showcases the power of combining SQL for data analysis and Power BI for visualization to uncover valuable insights from extensive HR datasets. The actionable findings generated through this analysis can guide HR professionals and organizational leaders in making data-driven decisions to optimize workforce management and drive organizational success.
